Yeah. Well, one of my places is kind of the opposite of yours. It's not a big city, but you said the Pacific Northwest, and I said the Northeast. I've never been to Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, this area. And I feel like one of the best road trips would be driving all the way up the East Coast of the U.S., and going around Maine, and coming down through Vermont. I think all of that geography is just really different than everywhere else I've visited in the U.S. I've heard the coasts, like the Northeast coasts are really rocky, and lots of just kind of rugged coastline, that I think would be really cool to see. And the forests, I've heard the forests in Vermont are amazing, just a different type of feel. We live in the mountains here in North Carolina, which is also a great place to visit-\", 273), (' ... but we already are here.', 275), (' But I feel like the mountains, and the forests, and the coast, and other places are pretty various.', 277), (\" Yeah, that'd be cool.\", 279), (' Yeah, maybe do that.', 281), (' Yeah.', 283), (\" That'd be cool.\", 285), (\" That would be fun. Well, one of my others was kind of similar to what you were saying with Colorado and that area, is going to Yosemite National Park. I feel like it's just a classic place to visit in the U.S. because there's so many national parks on the West Coast, it's kind of hard to choose.

Everyone was cramming to camp in that spot.', 297), (\" So yeah, I guess it's really popular. And that was for the whole year, that wasn't just for that day. That was to book a spot to camp for that whole year. Anyway, that's crazy. So maybe we'll do that. Maybe we need to book it five years in advance, but I think it'd be cool to visit national parks in the west because most tourism, well there's a lot of city tourism in the U.S., but I feel like a lot of tourism is natural tourism.\", 299), (\" Yeah. Yeah, because I feel like the U.S. is such a young country that we don't have Rome, we don't have these old cities, and this kind of stuff you can visit in cities, it's more nature, which is also old.\", 301), (\" Yeah, except New York's got a lot of cool stuff.\", 303), (\" It's a cool place to visit.\", 305), (' Yeah.', 307), (' Oh, well I heard another quote that said, \"New York is twice as fun, but it\\'s three times as expensive.\" So it\\'s really fun, but it\\'s even more expensive.', 309), (' Especially if you live there.

I'm curious, if you've ever been to Hawaii if you'd recommend it. I know your parents are planning on going there next May.\", 321), (\" We will have a two month old baby when they go. Maybe we'll go to Hawaii, I don't know. It's a little soon, I think.\", 323), (\" We'll let you know.\", 325), (\" I think it'd be really cool to go to Hawaii, just to see volcanoes, and hiking, and moving around, and scuba diving, and it's so different.\", 327), (\" They can watch our kids, so we're going to crash their vacation and make them watch our kids-\", 329), (' ... while we go have fun?', 331), (\" Sounds great, so I'm curious for you, what are some locations that you'd like to visit in the U.S.?

What kind of tacos do you like to make, because there's so many different types-\", 391), (' I like when you make fish tacos.', 393), (\" Sometimes when Dan makes fish tacos, or sometimes I make them too, we get some kind of white fish like cod or tilapia, and bread it, and then bake it so it's baked, and then you have some kind of cabbage slaw mixed up on top with some spices in it, and you put that on the tortilla with the fish, with the kind of spicy cabbage, maybe slices of avocado.\", 395), (' Yeah, some mayo, maybe some-', 397), (\" ... pico de gallo, some salsa on top, that's also great.
